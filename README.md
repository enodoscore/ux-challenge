# ux-challenge

First of all, we want to thank you for taking the time to speak with our team and for taking our UX Challenge. We understand your time is valuable and we appreciate you putting your energies into this challenge. 

We devised this challenge so you would not need a commercial real estate background to show your skills and abilities. 

### Background:

Attached are screenshots and sketch files for two projects we are currently working on. One is from the Underwriting Narrative and represents the full summary needed to complete a loan. The second is the more condensed Origination Quote which captures the minimum amount of information necessary to provide the borrower with a term sheet. The Underwriting Narrative is moving to the same design system as the Loan Quote so treat the Quote as the most up-to-date version of the product. 

### Goal:

Provide an explanation and mockup/ wireframe showing how you would address the below prompts. Go into as much detail as you find necessary to articulate your design decisions. Be prepared to walk through the challenge with various team members. 

### Prompts:

* **Merging Design Systems** - Although these two components are related to each other, there are differences in their design; left navigation, card style, and headers among other things. How would you merge these two style together? In addition to visual or UX changes, logistically, how would you optimize the designs process to ensure a smooth hand off with the engineering team? I have also attached a full version of the Narrative and the outline for the Loan Quote including screen shots from each section. 

* **Status/ Progression** - In the Underwriting Narrative, progression is being expressed in a few different ways; the icons/ colors in the left navigation, the progress bar in the title, questions completed metric, and overall completion percentage. How would you express progression so it is clear to someone working through a deal, as well as someone who wants to see the status at a glance (a manager for instance)?

* **Navigation** - The Underwriting Narrative has 340 individual form fields and 8 sections, the loan quote is shorter with 5 sections, but is still quite long. How would you optimize the navigation so a user can easily jump to a specific section or follow the workflow in sequential order? 

Please email robert@enodoinc.com if you have any questions about the challenge or industry specific questions I may be able to answer.
